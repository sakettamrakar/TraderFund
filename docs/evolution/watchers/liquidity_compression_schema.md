# Liquidity Compression Schema
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Type**: Diagnostic Output
**Layer**: Evolution (Watcher)

## Overview
This schema defines the output for `liquidity_compression.json`, generated by the `LiquidityCompressionWatcher`. It diagnoses whether markets are compressed, range-bound, or liquidity-suppressed based on Factor Context v1.3.

## Schema Definition
```yaml
liquidity_compression:
  version: "1.0.0"
  computed_at: ISO8601_TIMESTAMP
  window_id: string
  regime: string

  state:
    type: enum
    values:
      - COMPRESSED        # Volatility Contracting + Dispersion Low/Stable
      - NEUTRAL           # Stable Volatility + Stable Dispersion
      - EXPANDING         # Volatility Expanding + Dispersion Expanding

  contributing_factors:
    volatility_regime: string  # from factor_context.factors.volatility
    dispersion_state: string   # from factor_context.factors.value.dispersion

  confidence: float
  notes: string | null
```

## State Definitions
1.  **COMPRESSED**:
    *   Condition: `volatility_regime == contracting` OR (`dispersion == contracting` AND `volatility != expanding`)
    *   Meaning: Market is coiling; potential for breakout or liquidity shock.
2.  **EXPANDING**:
    *   Condition: `volatility_regime == expanding` OR `dispersion == expanding`
    *   Meaning: Opportunity set is widening; volatility is realizing.
3.  **NEUTRAL**:
    *   Condition: Everything else (e.g., `stable`/`stable`).
    *   Meaning: Steady state environment.
