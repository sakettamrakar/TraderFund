# Dispersion Breakout Schema
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Type**: Diagnostic Output
**Layer**: Evolution (Watcher)

## Overview
This schema defines the output for `dispersion_breakout.json`, generated by the `DispersionBreakoutWatcher`. It detects the widening of opportunity sets (dispersion) before alpha becomes scalable.

## Schema Definition
```yaml
dispersion_breakout:
  version: "1.0.0"
  computed_at: ISO8601_TIMESTAMP
  window_id: string
  
  state:
    type: enum
    values:
      - NONE                  # Dispersion stable or contracting
      - EARLY_BREAKOUT        # Dispersion expanding
      - CONFIRMED_BREAKOUT    # Dispersion expanding + Persistence

  contributing_factors:
    dispersion: string        # contracting | stable | expanding
    persistence: string       # intermittent | persistent | fading

  confidence: float
  notes: string | null
```

## State Definitions
1.  **NONE**: Dispersion is dormant.
2.  **EARLY_BREAKOUT**:
    *   Condition: `dispersion == expanding`
    *   Meaning: Valuation spreads are widening.
3.  **CONFIRMED_BREAKOUT**:
    *   Condition: `dispersion == expanding` AND `persistence == persistent`
    *   Meaning: A sustained alpha opportunity set is forming.
