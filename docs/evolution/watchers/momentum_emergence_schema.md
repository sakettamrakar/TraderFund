# Momentum Emergence Schema
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Type**: Diagnostic Output
**Layer**: Evolution (Watcher)

## Overview
This schema defines the output for `momentum_emergence.json`, generated by the `MomentumEmergenceWatcher`. It records the structural formation state of momentum based on Factor Context v1.2.

## Schema Definition
```yaml
momentum_emergence:
  version: "1.0.0"
  computed_at: ISO8601_TIMESTAMP
  window_id: string
  regime: string

  state:
    type: enum
    values:
      - NONE                  # Momentum absent or noise
      - EMERGING_ATTEMPT      # Acceleration + Short time
      - EMERGING_CONFIRMING   # Acceleration + Breadth + Dispersion
      - EMERGING_PERSISTENT   # Persistent + Time-in-state

  contributing_factors:
    acceleration: string      # from factor_context
    breadth: string           # from factor_context
    dispersion: string        # from factor_context
    persistence: string       # from factor_context
    time_in_state: string     # from factor_context

  confidence: float           # Computed confidence of emergence
  notes: string | null        # Diagnostic notes
```

## State Definitions
1.  **EMERGING_ATTEMPT**:
    *   Condition: `acceleration=accelerating` AND `time_in_state=short`
    *   Meaning: Momentum is potentially initializing.
2.  **EMERGING_CONFIRMING**:
    *   Condition: `acceleration=accelerating` AND `breadth=broad` AND `dispersion=expanding`
    *   Meaning: Momentum is gaining structural confirmation.
3.  **EMERGING_PERSISTENT**:
    *   Condition: `persistence=persistent` AND `time_in_state IN [medium, long]`
    *   Meaning: Momentum state is structurally entrenched.
