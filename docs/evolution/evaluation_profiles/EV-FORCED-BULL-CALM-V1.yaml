description: >
  Counterfactual stress test under forced Bull Calm regime. This profile overrides
  regime detection and injects a constant BULL_CALM regime across all evaluation
  windows. Used to understand strategy sensitivity to regime assumptions and to
  test behavior under hypothetical market conditions.

    rationale: >
      Counterfactual stress testing. Forces Bull Calm regime to evaluate
      strategy behavior under sustained low-volatility bullish conditions,
      regardless of actual historical market state.
