# Final Readiness Summary

System is not ready for controlled Truth Advancement.

## Basis
- Temporal drift remains unresolved and material (`US +7d`, `INDIA +10d`).
- Governance source-of-truth is internally inconsistent across epoch artifacts.
- Real-only ingestion constraints were violated by synthetic IN10Y generation.
- Core policy path is not schema-stable across orchestration outputs.
- Narrative reality path cannot currently produce auditable output from live endpoint conditions.

## Invariants Preserved During This Run
- Truth epoch was not advanced during IRR or Shadow run execution.
- Execution remained disabled (`execution_gate=CLOSED`).
- No live order or capital deployment path was activated.
