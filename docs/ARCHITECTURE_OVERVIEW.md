# Institutional Trading Assistant Architecture Outline

## Core Architectural Principles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each functional module is packaged as an independently deployable service with its own data store where appropriate. This promotes loose coupling and enables individual scaling of services.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Modules communicate primarily through asynchronous events using a message broker (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ). This ensures resilience and real-time responsiveness.
- **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-documented RESTful APIs. Clear contracts between services ease integration and future extension.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: Data ingestion, processing and storage components are designed for high volumes of streaming and historical financial data.
- **Robust Security and Compliance**: Authentication, authorization, encryption and compliance checks are embedded at every layer.

## Module Tiers

The 32 modules are organized into three tiers reflecting complexity and user sophistication.

### Core Modules (Beginner to Intermediate)

Provide fundamental trading utilities such as watchlist management, technical and fundamental screening, simple risk estimation and trade notifications. These modules form the essential building blocks for basic trading workflows.

### Pro Modules (Advanced)

Extend core capabilities with news and sentiment analysis, advanced strategy engines, volatility filters and more comprehensive backtesting tools. They target experienced traders and quantitative analysts requiring greater control and analytics.

### Institutional-Grade Modules (Hedge Fund Tier)

Deliver enterprise-level functionality such as portfolio optimization, VaR and stress testing, OMS/EMS with Smart Order Routing, and sophisticated compliance engines. These are geared toward regulated institutions with stringent risk and reporting requirements.

## Data Flow and Storage

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects real-time and historical data from exchanges, data vendors and news feeds via APIs, websockets and web scraping.
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Cleans, normalizes and transforms raw data, performing corporate action adjustments and indicator calculations.
3. **Data Storage**:
   - **Time-Series Database** (e.g., InfluxDB) for high frequency market data and indicators.
   - **Relational Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL) for reference data, configuration, trade journals and compliance logs.
   - **Data Lake** (e.g., S3-compatible) for raw or semi-structured data such as news articles and alternative datasets.
   - **Feature Store** to manage engineered features for machine learning models.
4. **Data Consumption**: Modules access data via APIs or subscribe to relevant event streams.

## Inter-Module Communication

- **Message Broker**: The backbone for asynchronous communication. Modules publish and subscribe to events like `SignalGenerated`, `TradeExecuted` or `RiskLimitBreached`.
- **RESTful APIs**: Used for synchronous requests including reference data queries, fetching historical data on demand and submitting orders to the OMS/EMS.

## Compliance and Risk Management

- **Pre-Trade Compliance Engine**: Validates trade instructions against rules such as position limits and restricted lists before execution.
- **Real-Time Risk Monitoring**: Continuously assesses portfolio and market risk, generating alerts or automated actions if thresholds are breached.
- **Post-Trade Surveillance**: Inspects executed trades for regulatory violations and suspicious activity.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains detailed logs of system actions and decisions for regulatory reporting and audits.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Each microservice is packaged as a Docker container for consistent deployment.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (or similar) manages containers, providing high availability and scaling.
- **Cloud-Native Principles**: Cloud services supply scalable infrastructure, managed databases and cost efficiency.

This architecture delivers a modular, scalable and compliant trading platform suitable for institutional use.
