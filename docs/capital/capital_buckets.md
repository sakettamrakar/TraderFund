# Capital Buckets (Symbolic)

**Total Paper Capital**: 100 Units

This document defines the **ceilings** for capital allocation per strategy family. These are hard limits, not targets. Unused capital remains idle (Cash).

## Family Ceilings

| Strategy Family | Max Allocation (%) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Momentum** | **25%** | High capacity, but subject to reversal risk. |
| **Value / Quality** | **35%** | Core portfolio ballast. Regime robust. |
| **Volatility / Defensive** | **25%** | Crisis alpha and structural hedging. |
| **Relative / Spread** | **15%** | Capacity constrained, high precision required. |
| **Carry** | **15%** | Cyclical exposure, naturally limited by leverage constraints. |
| **Liquidity / Stress** | **10%** | Only active during distinct crisis regimes. |

## Rules

1.  **Ceilings are Absolute**: No strategy family may exceed its assigned percentage of Total Paper Capital under any circumstances.
2.  **No Re-allocation**: Unused capacity in one bucket **cannot** be transferred to another.
3.  **Idle Default**: If no strategies are eligible, 100% of capital remains in Cash (Idle).
