## 1. Definition: Decision-Adjacent Artifact (Canon)

A **Decision-Adjacent Artifact** is any artifact that:

*   Selects, ranks, narrows, or flags symbols.
*   Emits "interesting", "candidate", "actionable" language.
*   Implies *what to look at* rather than *what is true*.
*   Sits downstream of research but upstream of humans.

### Clarifications

*   **Research verdict ≠ decision**: A research verdict states a fact about the world (e.g., "Momentum is High"). It does not imply "Buy this".
*   **Eligibility ≠ recommendation**: Eligibility rules filter out invalid symbols (e.g., "Volume too low"). They do not rank the remaining ones.
*   **Explanation ≠ instruction**: Explaining why a symbol is eligible is descriptive. Telling a human to trade it is prescriptive.

This definition is **canonical**.
