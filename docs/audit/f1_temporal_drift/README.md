# F1 Temporal Drift Audit Logs

This directory stores append-only audit logs generated by F1 drift remediation controls.

Generated files:
- `drift_breaches.jsonl`: emitted when `evaluation_drift_days > max_drift_days`.
- `evaluation_window_requests.jsonl`: emitted for each `REQUEST_EVALUATION_WINDOW` action (accepted/rejected).

These logs are runtime artifacts and are intentionally append-only.
