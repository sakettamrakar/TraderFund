# Decision D012.5: Scale & Safety Plane Authorization

**Decision ID**: D012.5  
**Decision Name**: Scale & Safety Plane Authorization  
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-25T07:38:29+05:30  
**Scope**:  
- **Plane**: Scale & Safety (SS)  
- **Phase**: Pre-Decision Survivability  
**Status**: COMMITTED

---

## 1. Preconditions (Why Survivability Constraints Are Allowed Now)

The following preconditions have been verified and are hereby attested:

### Plane Closure Status

| Plane | Obligations | Status |
|:------|:------------|:-------|
| **Control Plane** (D009) | `OBL-CP-*` (4/4) | ✅ ALL SATISFIED |
| **Orchestration Plane** (D010) | `OBL-OP-*` (5/5) | ✅ ALL SATISFIED |
| **Strategy Plane** (D011) | `OBL-SP-*` (4/4) | ✅ ALL SATISFIED |
| **Structural Activation** (D012) | `OBL-SA-*` (5/5) | ✅ ALL SATISFIED |

### Key Guarantees in Place

| Guarantee | Evidence |
|:----------|:---------|
| **Epistemic Governance** | Belief Layer operationalized, 13 rules enforced. |
| **Orchestration Discipline** | Deterministic DAG execution, no implicit side effects. |
| **Strategy Non-Logic** | Strategies are declarative intent only, zero executable code. |
| **Read-Only State** | Macro/Factor state exposed as facts, not choices. |
| **No-Decision Guarantee** | `OBL-SA-NO-DECISION` verified. |

**Conclusion**: The system has complete visibility but zero execution capability. Before any decision or execution plane can be opened, survivability constraints must be established.

## 2. Decision Statement (Core Authorization)

By this decision, the following is authorized:

> **The Scale & Safety Plane is hereby opened for pre-decision survivability constraint definition.**

This authorization permits:

1.  **Kill-Switch Mechanism**: A global, authoritative halt capability.
2.  **Bounded Execution Limits**: Hard limits on strategies, frequency, fan-out.
3.  **Determinism Guarantees**: Order-preserving behavior under scale.
4.  **Circuit Breakers**: Safe degradation under stress.
5.  **Audit Scalability**: Bounded, governed ledger growth.

This authorization is subject to the following **absolute constraints**:

1.  All SS work is **subordinate** to Control Plane governance.
2.  All SS work is **bound** by Orchestration enforcement.
3.  All SS work **respects** Strategy non-logic guarantees.
4.  All SS work **operates on** Structural Activation read-only state only.
5.  **No decision-making, execution, or market interaction is authorized.**

## 3. Explicit Non-Authorizations (What D012.5 Does NOT Permit)

To prevent misinterpretation, this decision **explicitly does NOT authorize**:

| Prohibited Action | Rationale |
|:------------------|:----------|
| **Decision-Making** | Requires Decision Plane (D013+). |
| **Strategy Execution** | Requires Execution Plane (D014+). |
| **Signal Evaluation** | Signal processing requires Belief inference. |
| **Market Interaction** | Requires Production Readiness Gate. |
| **Conditional Branching on Outcomes** | Outcome-driven logic is execution. |
| **Trade Placement** | Requires full system authorization. |
| **Risk Calculation** | Risk models imply decision support. |

### Safety Assertion

> **Scale & Safety constrains future behavior but does not enable any behavior.**
> 
> This plane makes execution *survivable*, not *possible*.

Any work that falls into the prohibited categories is **INVALID** under this decision.

## 4. Obligations Triggered by D012.5

The following obligations become **binding but unmet** upon commitment of this decision:

| Obligation ID | Description | Satisfied By | Status |
|:--------------|:------------|:-------------|:-------|
| **OBL-SS-KILLSWITCH** | Global halt mechanism must exist and be verified. | `SS-5.x` | 🔴 UNMET |
| **OBL-SS-BOUNDS** | Hard limits on strategies, frequency, fan-out declared and enforced. | `SS-5.x` | 🔴 UNMET |
| **OBL-SS-DETERMINISM** | Behavior remains deterministic under load. | `SS-5.x` | 🔴 UNMET |
| **OBL-SS-CIRCUIT** | Safe degradation and circuit breakers implemented. | `SS-5.x` | 🔴 UNMET |
| **OBL-SS-AUDIT** | Ledger and DID generation remain bounded at scale. | `SS-5.x` | 🔴 UNMET |
| **OBL-SS-CLOSURE** | All OBL-SS-* must be satisfied for plane closure. | *All SS Tasks* | 🔴 UNMET |

These obligations **absolutely block** any Decision or Execution Plane authorization.

## 5. Governance & Audit Trail

| Item | Value |
|:-----|:------|
| **Ledger Entry** | This decision is to be appended to `docs/epistemic/ledger/decisions.md`. |
| **DID Generation** | A Documentation Impact Declaration is to be generated for `task_graph.md`. |
| **Decision Chain** | D009 → D010 → D011 → D012 → **D012.5** |
| **Successor** | D013 (Decision Plane Authorization) — **contingent on OBL-SS-CLOSURE** |

## 6. Closure Statement

This decision authorizes **survivability controls only**.

It does **not** authorize:
- Decision-making
- Strategy execution
- Market interaction
- Any form of "choice"

**All decision authority remains absolutely forbidden.**

The Scale & Safety Plane is now open for constraint definition under the governance of all prior planes.

**Guiding Principle**:
> *Visibility makes systems smart.*
> *Survivability makes systems safe.*
> *Only safe systems are allowed to choose.*
