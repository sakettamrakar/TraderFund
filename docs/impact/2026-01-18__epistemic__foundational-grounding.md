# Documentation Impact Declaration

**Change Summary**: Established canonical epistemic grounding, ledgers, and skill catalog.
**Change Type**: Architecture / Invariant / Epistemic

## Impact Analysis
*   **Potentially Impacted Documents**: All future project documentation, runbooks, and implementation PRs.
*   **Impact Nature**: All future changes must now adhere to the defined cognitive hierarchy (Regime > Event > Narrative) and mandatory documentation side effects (DIDs). Invariants like "Event Time Integrity" and "Context Before Signal" are now enforceable.

## Required Actions
*   [ ] Human review of `docs/epistemic/` hierarchy.
*   [ ] Human approval of `docs/epistemic/ledger/decisions.md` initial entries.
*   [ ] Formalization of `Change Summarizer` skill use in workflow.

## Epistemic Impact
*   **Invariants Affected**: Architectural Invariants established (Event Time, No Lookahead, Cognitive Ordering).
*   **Constraints Affected**: Active Constraints established (Cognitive Bandwidth, API limits).

**Status**: Rejected
Human Review: Rejected
