# Component: Portfolio Intelligence
# Level: L9 (Portfolio Intelligence)

name: Portfolio Intelligence
responsibility: >
  Diagnostic and advisory intelligence layer. Scans the filtered candidate pool
  and existing portfolio for structural risks, mismatches, and decay signals.

domain_entities_used:
  - PortfolioDiagnostic (L9): RegimeConflict, NarrativeDecay, FactorMismatch, HorizonMismatch
  - RegimeState (L1): Required for conflict detection
  - NarrativeObject (L2): Required for decay detection
  - FactorState (L4): Required for mismatch checks

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Constraint Engine (L8)
    Data: Filtered candidate pool
  - Source: Ingestion US/India (L0)
    Data: Current portfolio holdings
  - Source: Regime Engine (L1)
    Data: RegimeState
  - Source: Narrative Engine (L2)
    Data: NarrativeObjects
  - Source: Factor Engine (L4)
    Data: FactorState

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: FlaggedWatchlist (symbol, severity, flags[], sizing_suggestion)
  - Target: Human Operator
    Data: Advisory intelligence and diagnostic reports

invariants:
  - Output is strictly diagnostic + advisory; zero auto-execution commands.
  - Human authority is absolute; the system informs but does not decide.
  - Every flag must trace to a specific cognitive layer conflict (Traceability).
  - Severity classification (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green) is deterministic.

forbidden:
  - Executing trades or placing orders independently.
  - Hiding or auto-suppressing critical diagnostic flags.
  - Producing trade recommendations using certainty language ("You MUST buy").
  - Overriding manual human overrides.

failure_modes:
  - Regime Stale: High uncertainty in conflict detection (Auto-flag as STALE/AMBIGUOUS).
  - Data starvation: Narratives or Factors missing (Diagnostic Degradation).
  - Alert Fatigue: 100% of holdings flagged Red (Communication Failure).

observability:
  - Flag Frequency: Metric tracking the distribution of flags (Regime vs Factor vs Narrative).
  - Severity Mix: Metric tracking the volume of Red/Orange/Yellow flags.
  - Diagnostic Latency: Time from candidate arrival to diagnostic output.
