# Component: Factor Engine
# Level: L4 (Factor Analysis — Reward Map)

name: Factor Engine
responsibility: >
  Determines current market style rewards (Momentum, Value, Quality, Size).
  Issues FactorPermissions that gate downstream discovery and strategy activation.

domain_entities_used:
  - FactorSignal (L4): strength, direction, stability, horizon
  - FactorPermission (L4): binary grant/denial per style
  - RegimeState (L1): Context for factor-regime alignment

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Regime Engine (L1)
    Data: RegimeState
  - Source: Meta-Analysis Engine (L3)
    Data: TrustScores
  - Source: Canonical Store (L0)
    Data: Returns, volatility, sector performance

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Strategy Selector (L5), Factor Lens (L6)
    Data: FactorState, FactorPermissions
  - Target: Portfolio Intelligence (L9)
    Data: Factor alignment reports (reward map)

invariants:
  - Factors describe styles/categories, not individual assets.
  - Factor permissions are binary grants; absence equals denial (Fail-Closed).
  - No signal may bypass factor permissions (Layer Integrity).

forbidden:
  - Selecting individual stock tickers (Asset selection belongs to L6).
  - Operating without active RegimeState.
  - Modifying FactorPermissions manually without recorded governance authorization.

failure_modes:
  - Numerical instability in factor computation: Output INSUFFICIENT_DATA.
  - Permission Lag: Permissions out of sync with rapid regime transitions.
  - Factor Confusion: High strength signals in conflicting directions (Trend vs Value).

observability:
  - Permission Logs: Record all changes to factor grants/denials.
  - Factor Strength Heatmap: Daily metric of factor returns vs baseline.
  - Decision Trace: Link every FactorPermission to specific L1 and L3 inputs.
