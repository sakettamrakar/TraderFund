# Component: Narrative Lens
# Level: L6 (Opportunity Discovery — Parallel Lens)

name: Narrative Lens
responsibility: >
  Scans active NarrativeObjects for theme-driven investment dislocations.
  Identifies opportunities where narrative momentum creates tradeable setups.

domain_entities_used:
  - OpportunityCandidate (L6): symbol, source_lenses, horizon, preliminary_scores
  - NarrativeObject (L2): Active narratives as primary screening input

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Narrative Engine (L2)
    Data: Active NarrativeObjects (Born / Reinforced)
  - Source: Regime Engine (L1)
    Data: RegimeState for context weighting

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Convergence Engine (L7)
    Data: OpportunityCandidates (source_lens="Narrative")
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: Narrative-to-Asset association map

invariants:
  - Operates in parallel with other lenses; zero cross-lens dependencies.
  - Only scans narratives in Born or Reinforced lifecycle states.
  - Does not generate trade instructions; emits discovery candidates only.

forbidden:
  - Using Resolved/Retired narratives for scanning.
  - Bypassing RegimeState context weighting.
  - Direct execution or capital allocation.
  - Modifying the underlying NarrativeObject.

failure_modes:
  - Zero active narratives: Lens produces empty candidate pool (Valid State).
  - Ambiguous asset mapping: High-confidence narrative with low-confidence asset link.
  - Data mismatch: Asset listed in narrative does not exist in Canonical Store.

observability:
  - Candidate Volume: Metric tracking number of candidates surfaced per narrative.
  - Association Strength: Log confidence of narrative-to-asset links.
  - Latency: Time from narrative update to candidate generation.
