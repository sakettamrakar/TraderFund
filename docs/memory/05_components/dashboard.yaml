# Component: Dashboard (Observer UI)
# Level: Observation Layer (Cross-Cutting)

name: Dashboard (Observer UI)
responsibility: >
  Read-only operator interface. Visualizes system state across all cognitive layers (L1-L9).
  Enforces "Diagnostics Over Commands" and ensures glass-box observability.

domain_entities_used:
  - All Domain Entities: RegimeState, NarrativeObject, CandidateAssessment, PortfolioDiagnostic, etc.

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: All Backend APIs
    Data: Current system state, temporal artifacts, governance status
  - Source: Epistemic Documents
    Data: Invariants, success criteria metrics

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Human Operator
    Data: Interactive visualizations, Briefing reports, Inspection Mode views

invariants:
  - Strictly read-only; zero mutation or write operations permitted.
  - Every displayed metric or flag must trace to its source layer/file.
  - No hidden states; all logic must be observable (Glass-Box Principle).
  - Multi-market states (US/India) must be visually distinct and temporally aligned.

forbidden:
  - Any write/update operation to backend state.
  - Hiding governance holds or failure states.
  - Displaying certainty language, advice, or trade recommendations.
  - Bypassing backend validation for display logic.
  - Allowing execution or capital control from the UI surface.

failure_modes:
  - API Connection Failure: Display explicit "DISCONNECTED" state with retry link.
  - Stale Data: State displayed without visible TTL/Staleness indicator (Violation).
  - Inspection Mode persistence: View stuck in simulation mode (Requires Reset).

observability:
  - Session Analytics: Tracking user interaction with diagnostic flags.
  - Page Latency: Time to render full cognitive state (L1-L9 summary).
  - Error Tracking: Logging frontend exceptions and API response failures.

success_criteria_refs:
