# Component: Strategy Selector
# Level: L5 (Strategy Selection — Playbook)

name: Strategy Selector
responsibility: >
  Determines which strategy playbooks are active based on RegimeState and FactorPermissions.
  Manages strategy lifecycle (DRAFT → ACTIVE → SUSPENDED → RETIRED).

domain_entities_used:
  - ActiveStrategySet (L5): Permitted playbooks
  - RegimeState (L1): Compatibility master
  - FactorPermission (L4): Statistical gating

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Regime Engine (L1)
    Data: RegimeState
  - Source: Factor Engine (L4)
    Data: FactorPermissions
  - Source: Strategy Registry
    Data: Strategy metadata (compatibility, horizon, limits)
  - Source: Decision Ledger
    Data: Human authorization for lifecycle changes

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Strategy Lens (L6), Convergence Engine (L7)
    Data: ActiveStrategySet
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: Strategy lifecycle status, activation alerts

invariants:
  - Strategies consume beliefs; they do not produce or modify them (STR-1).
  - Strategies cannot bypass factor permissions (STR-2).
  - Every activation or suspension requires human authorization in the Decision Ledger.
  - Logic is version-frozen; no hot-patching of strategy parameters.

forbidden:
  - Self-activation or self-modification (Autonomous Violation).
  - Inferring regime or factor state independently (Authority Violation).
  - Operating with undeclared dependencies.
  - Generating execution instructions or trade signals.

failure_modes:
  - Regulatory conflict: Strategy active in incompatible regime (Auto-Suspend).
  - Staleness: Input data exceeds TTL (Auto-Suspend).
  - Decision backlog: Activation delayed by pending human review.

observability:
  - Lifecycle Trace: Log every strategy state change with Decision ID.
  - Activation Logic: Metric tracking which regimes trigger which playbooks.
  - Staleness Telemetry: Track age of inputs relative to strategy TTL.
