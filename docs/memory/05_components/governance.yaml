# Component: Governance
# Level: Cross-Cutting (Meta-Layer)

name: Governance
responsibility: >
  Enforcement of architectural rules, epistemic contracts, policy obligations, and Decision Ledger integrity.
  Ensures the system operates within defined "Success Criteria" and "Boundaries".

domain_entities_used:
  - All Domain Entities: Governance validates consistency across every cognitive level.

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Decision Ledger
    Data: Human-authorized decisions (ADRs)
  - Source: System Logs/Telemetry
    Data: Execution flow, diagnostic outputs, drift metrics
  - Source: Success Criteria
    Data: Behavioral benchmarks

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: All Components
    Data: Policy holds, suppression states, violation alerts
  - Target: Human Operator
    Data: Audit reports, compliance dashboard, drift alerts

invariants:
  - Governance is constitutional; violations reflect code failure, not policy failure.
  - No component may self-authorize state mutations (Human is the only authority).
  - Bounded automation rules are strictly enforced (Suggestions only).

forbidden:
  - Self-modifying governance logic without explicit Decision Ledger entry.
  - Silent degradation of constraints (Violation MUST be visible).
  - Autonomous execution of capital-affecting decisions.
  - Bypassing Truth Advancement Gates.

failure_modes:
  - Ledger Unavailability: System enters Lockdown Mode (Read-only, no updates).
  - False Positives: Drift detection flagging valid market noise as violation.
  - Policy Lag: Governance rules out of sync with new architectural deployments.

observability:
  - Violation Count: Metric tracking daily breaches of invariants.
  - Hold Duration: Tracking time between violation detection and human resolution.
  - Policy Coverage: Percentage of components with active governance monitoring.
