# Component: Data Ingestion (India)
# Level: L0 (Foundation)

name: Data Ingestion (India)
responsibility: >
  Live tick and historical market data acquisition for India equities via SmartAPI.
  Aggregates raw ticks into 1-minute candles and manages IST temporal alignment.

domain_entities_used:
  - TimeHorizon (L0): Tick-to-minute aggregation
  - CanonicalStore (L0): Bronze/Silver layers

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: SmartAPI WebSocket v2
    Data: Live ticks (LTP/Full), orderbook events
  - Source: SmartAPI REST
    Data: Historical 1m backfill
  - Source: India Watchlist
    Data: ~200 symbols (NIFTY 50 + Mid/Smallcap)

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Canonical Store (Silver/Gold)
    Data: 1-minute candles (Parquet)
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: WebSocket status, drop rate, IST temporal truth

invariants:
  - IST-First: All India data persists in IST to avoid clock-drift in aggregation.
  - WebSocket auto-reconnect with cumulative backoff.
  - Tick-to-Candle determinism: Replay of same tick stream produces identical candles.
  - Physical Separation: Zero shared code/state with US ingestion.

forbidden:
  - REST polling for live price updates during market hours (WebSocket mandatory).
  - Cross-market state sharing (US context in India pipeline).
  - Modifying IST timestamps to UTC during raw persistence.

failure_modes:
  - Feed Gap: WebSocket disconnected silently (Requires heart-beat check).
  - High Latency: Processing backlog during high-volatility tick bursts.
  - Token Expiry: SmartAPI session timeout (Auto-refresh required).

observability:
  - Tick Rate: Incoming messages per second.
  - Drop Rate: Percentage of ticks missed during reconnection.
  - Aggregation Health: Candle count vs Expected count based on IST market hours.
