# Component: Data Ingestion (US)
# Level: L0 (Foundation)

name: Data Ingestion (US)
responsibility: >
  Historical and daily market data acquisition for US equities via Alpha Vantage.
  Manages symbol universe, rate limiting, normalization, and UTC alignment.

domain_entities_used:
  - TimeHorizon (L0): Daily/Intraday alignment
  - CanonicalStore (L0): Bronze/Silver layers

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Alpha Vantage REST API
    Data: TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED, TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY
  - Source: Symbol Registry
    Data: Active listing status, sector membership

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Canonical Store (Silver/Gold)
    Data: Normalized Parquet (adjusted OHLCV)
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: Pipeline health, rate limit utilization

invariants:
  - Rate limits strictly enforced via token-bucket mechanism.
  - Raw data is immutable (Schema versioning used for corrections).
  - All timestamps normalized to UTC before Silver layer persistence.
  - Idempotency: Re-running on same API response produces bit-identical Parquet.

forbidden:
  - Real-time streaming (Restricted to REST/Batch by architecture).
  - Merging US/India schemas into a single shared file.
  - Mutating historical Bronze-layer JSON artifacts.
  - Using black-box/API computed indicators as source of truth.

failure_modes:
  - API 429: Rate limit exceeded (Retry with exponential backoff).
  - Zero-Length Response: API returns empty set (Reject update, maintain T-1).
  - Schema Drift: Unexpected change in Alpha Vantage response keys.

observability:
  - Throughput: Records per hour processed.
  - Quality Score: Percentage of rows passing OHLC integrity checks (High >= Low).
  - Latency: Delta between market close and Gold-layer availability.
