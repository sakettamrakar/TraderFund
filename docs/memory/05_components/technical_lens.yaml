# Component: Technical Lens
# Level: L6 (Opportunity Discovery — Parallel Lens)

name: Technical Lens
responsibility: >
  Scans for price action setups and momentum signals using technical indicators.
  Identifies breakouts, support/resistance, and trend strength.
  Indicator computation (RSI, SMA, etc.) is an internal detail, not a separate layer.

domain_entities_used:
  - OpportunityCandidate (L6): symbol, source_lenses, horizon, preliminary_scores
  - RegimeState (L1): Used for regime-based signal filtering

upstream_inputs:
  - Source: Canonical Store (L0)
    Data: OHLCV (Daily + Intraday)
  - Source: Regime Engine (L1)
    Data: RegimeState context
  - Source: Momentum Engine (Scanner Feed)
    Data: Intraday alerts (VWAP, HOD, RVOL)

downstream_outputs:
  - Target: Convergence Engine (L7)
    Data: OpportunityCandidates (source_lens="Technical")
  - Target: Dashboard
    Data: Technical rationale (indicators, pattern names)

invariants:
  - Operates in parallel; zero cross-lens dependencies.
  - Indicator computation is local (determinism check via hash).
  - Indicators return NaN/Reset on data gaps beyond MAX_GAP threshold.

forbidden:
  - Bypassing local computation (Relying on external/API computed indicators).
  - Bypassing RegimeState filter context.
  - Generating execution instructions or price targets.
  - Using future price data (Lookahead Bias).

failure_modes:
  - Lookback Window Insufficiency: Insufficient trailing data for long indicators (e.g. 200 SMA).
  - Data Gap reset: Excessive gaps causing indicator "blindness".
  - Noise: High-volatility sideways action producing false breakout signals.

observability:
  - Signal Density: Tracking number of technical setups per regime type.
  - Indicator Health: Logging number of symbols with NaN/Reset indicator states.
  - Setup Frequency: Metric per pattern type (e.g., "Breakout", "Mean Reversion").
