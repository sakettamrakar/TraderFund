# Decision Protocol

## Tier 1 — Reversible
AI may execute directly.

Examples:
- code changes
- UI tweaks
- prompt tuning

## Tier 2 — Structural
AI proposes.
Human approves.

Examples:
- component contracts
- execution model
- data flow.

## Tier 3 — Irreversible
AI provides advisory brief.
Human decides.

Examples:
- vision
- scope
- success criteria
- core architecture.

## Escalation Format

When Tier 3 is touched, AI must return:

- Proposed change
- Why
- Pros
- Cons
- Alternatives
- Risk level
- Impacted memory files

## Human Override

Human may override any rule.

After override:
memory + ADR must be updated.
