# Vision

## Why This Project Exists

TraderFund is a **regime-aware market intelligence system** designed to reduce emotionally driven and context-blind investment decisions. It exists to replace opaque "black box" investing with disciplined, observable, and scientifically grounded market understanding — enforcing strict data lineage, glass-box reasoning, and explicit uncertainty at every layer.

The goal is not prediction.
The goal is **situational clarity under uncertainty**.

## Core Philosophy: The 13-Level Cognitive Hierarchy

All analysis follows a strict, non-negotiable hierarchy.
Lower levels may refine insight but can never override higher levels.

**0. Purpose (Human Outcome)**
Reduce emotional trading and structural misalignment through clear situational awareness.

**1. Regime (Market Reality)**
Risk-on/off, liquidity states. Defines the market world. *(The Gatekeeper)*

**2. Narrative (Change Explanation)**
Causal reconstruction of what changed and why it matters. *(The Context)*

**3. Meta-Analysis (Trust Filter)**
Signal decay and strategy validity. Determines which tools are reliable. *(The Filter)*

**4. Factor Analysis (Reward Map)**
Momentum, Value, Quality, Volatility. Identifies rewarded and punished characteristics. *(The Map)*

**5. Strategy Selection (Conditional Playbooks)**
Activates playbooks based on Regime + Factors. *(The Playbook)*

**6. Opportunity Discovery (Multi-Lens Idea Generation)**
Parallel discovery lenses converge to unified candidates:
-   **Narrative Lens**: Theme-driven ideas (Tariffs, CapEx).
-   **Factor Lens**: Statistical reward patterns.
-   **Fundamental Lens**: Valuation and balance-sheet dislocation.
-   **Technical Lens**: Price action and accumulation.
-   **Strategy Lens**: Playbook-specific screens.
*Output: High-conviction ideas (multi-lens convergence) and structured watchlists.*

**7. Convergence & Scoring**
Merges candidates under regime-dependent weighting into ranked opportunity sets.

**8. Execution Constraints (Capital Preservation)**
Risk limits, exposure caps, position sizing. *(The Survival)*

**9. Portfolio Intelligence (Diagnostics)**
Evaluates existing holdings for regime compatibility, narrative decay, and structural misalignment. *(The Diagnostic)*

*(Future Capabilities — gated by system maturity)*
**10. Advisory Layer**: Portfolio-aware exposure guidance.
**11. Simulation**: Paper trading and historical validation.
**12. Live Execution**: Automated execution (final stage only).

## Product Philosophy

- **Diagnostics Over Commands**: The system diagnoses alignment; humans decide actions.
- **Glass-Box Observation**: Every output traces to a specific cognitive layer.
- **Uncertainty as a Feature**: Confidence and risk are explicit.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Final authority always remains with the user.
- **Conditional Intelligence**: Strategies are Regime + Factor dependent.

## Anti-Patterns

1.  **Level Skipping**: Acting on Technicals without Regime context.
2.  **Black-Box Decision Engines**: Unexplainable models are forbidden.
3.  **Future Prediction**: The system characterizes present probability, not forecasts.
4.  **Hidden Uncertainty**: Confidence must always be visible.
