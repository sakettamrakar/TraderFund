# ADR-0011: Multi-Human Governance

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Context**: As the system grows, multiple operators/contributors (Developers, PMs, Traders) will interact with it. We need a way to resolve conflicting requirements, prevent "truth forks", and attribute actions accurately.

## Decision

The system implements a **Multi-Human Governance** model:

- **Conflict Resolution**: "Freshness Rule" (most recent `main` state wins) + "Maintainer Veto" (original author holds foundational veto).
- **Attribution**: All significant actions (governance override, hold/release, kill-switch, parameter change) are logged with the verified **Operator ID**.
- **Quorum**: Overruling a veto requires a documented Quorum or Poject Owner sign-off (D0XX).

## Rationale

- **Clarity**: Prevents circular arguments and ambiguous status.
- **Accountability**: Everyone knows exactly *who* modified the system state and *when*.
- **Consistency**: "Truth Forks" (divergent beliefs about what the system is doing) are prevented by enforcing single-source-of-truth.

## Alternatives

- **Consensus Only**: All must agree. Rejected as deadlock-prone.
- ** benevolent Dictator**: One person decides everything. Rejected as unscalable.
- **Timestamp Priority**: Last write wins. Rejected (risks incoherent state).

## Consequences

- **Formalism**: Requires user/role definitions and authentication (simple CLI/Key based for now).
- **Process**: Conflicts escalate to formal Decision Ledger entries.
- **Log Volume**: Audit logs grow linearly with operator activity.

## Evidence

- `docs/epistemic/ledger/decisions.md`: D006 (Authorize Phase 4)
- `docs/epistemic/impact_resolution_contract.md`: Conflict Resolution Policy
