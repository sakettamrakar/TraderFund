# ADR-0009: Factor Context Explanation (EV-002)

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Context**: Rejections are opaque. When a strategy rejects a setup, we need to know *why* in a way that is structured and analyzable, not just "log: condition X failed". This requires distinct "Permissions" vs "Explanations".

## Decision

The system splits **Suitability** (Factor Context) from **Permissibility** (Regime + Factor Permission).

- **FactorContext**: Provides granular explanation of *why* a strategy rejects or accepts a setup (e.g., "Momentum > 0.8").
- **FactorPermission**: Binary gate (True/False) driven by Regime rules.

**Decision**: Strategies are **permitted to log** Factor Context fields (Suitability) for explanatory purposes. They are **FORBIDDEN** from gating execution on them (Permissibility) without explicit governance approval (EV-INV-004).

## Rationale

- **Explainability**: Allows debugging strategy logic without modifying the core gating rules.
- **Safety**: Separation of concerns prevents strategies from inventing new gating rules ad-hoc.
- **Evolution**: Enables data-driven refinement of strategy parameters over time.

## Alternatives

- **Unified Logic**: Strategy returns extensive reason codes. Rejected as conflating logic with reporting.
- **Log Only**: Just log strings. Rejected as unstructured and non-analyzable.
- **Auto-Tuning**: Let strategies adjust thresholds. Rejected as "Black Box ML Decision Engines".

## Consequences

- **Schema**: Factor Context schema needs to be maintained and versioned (v1.1 extension).
- **Code**: Strategies must implement `log_context()` separate from `evaluate_signal()`.
- **Latency**: Small overhead for structured logging.
