# ADR-0008: Forbidden Execution (INV-NO-EXECUTION)

**Status**: Accepted (Permanent)
**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Context**: Algorithmic trading systems can lose infinite amounts of capital in milliseconds. The primary failure mode is **unintended execution** (bugs, race conditions, erroneous signals). The system must be structurally incapable of this.

## Decision

The system is architected with a **permanent, verified invariant**: `INV-NO-EXECUTION`.

- **No live broker API keys** are loaded into the strategy logic.
- **No order placement libraries** are linked into the execution harness.
- **No capital movement** functions exist in the codebase.
- **Shadow Mode Only**: All "execution" is logged to a file (Shadow Sink), never to an exchange.

## Rationale

- **Safety First**: Infinite downside risk outweighs infinite upside potential.
- **Verification**: Allows testing logic on live data without risking real money.
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates stability and profitability *before* any capital is risked.

## Alternatives

- **Paper Trading API**: Use broker's paper trading. Rejected as it couples the system to broker availability and requires API keys.
- **Small Pilot**: Trade tiny amounts. Rejected as it violates the invariant and introduces risk.
- **Circuit Breakers Only**: Allow execution but halt on loss. Rejected as insufficient (software can fail before halt).

## Consequences

- **Deployment**: Getting to production requires a complex, multi-stage "Promotion" process (see ADR-0010).
- **Reality Gap**: Simulation (slippage, fills) is never perfect; real execution will differ.
- **Frustration**: Operators cannot capitalize on "obvious" winning signals immediately.
