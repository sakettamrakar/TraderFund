# ADR-0014: Single-Operator Infrastructure

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Context**: Most trading systems are designed for teams (Devs, Quants, Operators). However, this specific system has finite capacity and a "Research-Lead Discretionary" mandate for a **single principal**.

## Decision

The infrastructure is designed assuming a **Single Human Operator** (with potential future multi-operator governance logic, but single-runtime implementation).

- **Concurrency**: Operations are largely sequential or simple background tasks.
- **Authentication**: Local-access based (OS login, local `.env`). No complex OAuth/SSO.
- **State**: Centralized on one machine (the operator's workstation/server).

## Rationale

- **Focus**: Eliminates the overhead of distributed consensus, multi-user locking, and remote access security.
- **Speed**: "Local-first" interactions are instant.
- **Sovereignty**: The operator *owns* the system physically.

## Alternatives

- **SaaS Model**: Web-based multi-tenant. Rejected (requires cloud trust).
- **Client-Server**: Remote GUI connecting to backend. Rejected (adds network latency/failure modes).
- **Cluster**: Kubernetes cluster. Rejected (massive overkill).

## Consequences

- **Scalability**: Scaling to a team requires re-architecting the access layer (API gateway, auth).
- **Redundancy**: Single point of failure (the machine). Backups are critical.
- **Bus Factor**: High reliance on one individual (mitigated by "Boring is Beautiful" docs).

## Evidence

- `docs/memory/11_deployment/evolution.md`: §3.2 "Single-operator"
- `docs/memory/01_scope/boundaries.md`: "Authority: Human always decides."
