# ADR-0004: Shadow-Mode Validation

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Context**: Backtests are prone to overfitting, data snooping, and failing to capture execution nuances (slippage, latency, broker limits). Relying solely on them is risky. We need a way to prove the system works in the real world without risking capital.

## Decision

The system validates strategies via a **Shadow Mode** where live data is processed and signals are logged but **NOT EXECUTED**. This is distinct from backtesting and from live trading.

## Rationale

- **Realistic Pipeline**: Proves the *entire* pipeline (Ingestion -> Processing -> Signal -> Decision -> Logging) works in reality.
- **Operational Drift**: Catches discrepancies between historical data assumptions and live data quirks.
- **Traceability**: Allows for a verifiable audit trail of decisions made *without* capital at risk.

## Alternatives

- **Backtest Only**: Rely purely on historical performance. Rejected as insufficient for operational verification.
- **Micro-Lot Trading**: Trade tiny amounts. Rejected as it risks capital and adds complexity (broker fees, minimums).
- **Paper Trading (Broker)**: Use broker's paper trading API. Rejected as it introduces dependency on broker infrastructure availability, which may differ from production.

## Consequences

- **Overhead**: Requires maintaining a parallel "Shadow Execution Sink" alongside potential future real execution paths.
- **Patience**: Strategies must run in Shadow Mode for a significant period (Observation Phase) before promotion, delaying potential profits.
