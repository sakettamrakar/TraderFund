# ADR-0002: Separation of Signal vs Execution

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Context**: In many trading systems, the signal generation logic (alpha) is tightly coupled with execution logic (orders, sizing, broker limits). This coupling makes it hard to backtest signals purely, or to switch brokers/capital bases without rewriting the strategy.

## Decision

The Signal Generation layer (e.g., Momentum Engine) is **strictly decoupled** from the Execution layer. Use of a "Signal" object is the ONLY interface between them.

## Rationale

- **Purity**: Prevents execution constraints (capital, broker availability, margin) from polluting the mathematical purity of the alpha signal.
- **Reusability**: Allows reuse of the same signal engine for different capital bases, brokers, or simulation environments (Shadow Mode).
- **Testability**: Signals can be verified in isolation from complex broker interactions.

## Alternatives

- **Monolithic Strategy**: Strategy class handles both signal math and order placement. Rejected due to tight coupling and testing difficulty.
- **Callback-based**: Signal engine fires callbacks for execution. Rejected as it obscures the data boundary.

## Consequences

- **Strict Interface**: Must define a rigid `Signal` schema that captures all necessary intent without implementation details.
- **Latency**: Introduces a small serialization/deserialization step between signal and execution (negligible for this system's frequency).
- **Complexity**: Requires two distinct engines (Signal Engine, Execution Engine) instead of one.
