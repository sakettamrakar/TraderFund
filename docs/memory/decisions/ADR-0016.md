# ADR-0016: Explicit Truth Epoch (Temporal Sovereignty)

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Context**: Complex systems often race against the clock or suffer from "lookahead bias" when backtesting because they rely on `system_clock`. We need time to be a controllable variable.

## Decision

The system operates on an **Explicit Truth Epoch (TE)** model.

- **Time does not flow**: System time (`datetime.now()`) is never used for business logic.
- **Epochs are discrete**: Time advances only when a Governance Gate (Ingestion, Intelligence) is passed.
- **State is immutable**: Past epochs are frozen.

## Rationale

- **Idempotency**: We can re-run "yesterday" exactly as it happened, even if today is next week.
- **Safety**: Prevents lookahead bias (accessing future data).
- **Control**: Allows pausing the universe to debug a specific state.

## Alternatives

- **System Clock**: Use `datetime.now()`. Rejected (non-deterministic).
- **Event Driven**: React to ticks. Rejected (too complex for current phase, creates race conditions).

## Consequences

- **Complexity**: Every component must accept `epoch_id` or `as_of_date` as an argument.
- **Friction**: Ops must explicitly "advance time" (run the Daily Cycle).
- **Storage**: We store state per-epoch (deduplicated where possible).
