# ADR-0001: Market Pipeline Isolation

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Context**: Extracted from architectural invariants and existing design documents.

## Decision

India and US market data pipelines are **physically separate** with no shared state, no unified schema, and no code sharing.

## Rationale

- Regulatory and structural differences between markets (timezone, currency, corporate actions, exchange rules) make unified schemas error-prone
- Physical isolation prevents cross-contamination of data and logic
- Independent scaling and failure isolation per market
- Each pipeline can evolve at its own pace without blocking the other

## Consequences

- Some code patterns are duplicated across pipelines (accepted trade-off)
- Cross-market analysis requires explicit correlation logic in a separate layer
- Configuration and scheduling are maintained independently per market

## Evidence

- `docs/us_market_engine_design.md` Section 9: "We intentionally do not merge India and US data into a single table"
- `docs/epistemic/architectural_invariants.md` Item 4: "India vs US: Market pipelines are physically distinct with no shared state"
- `README.md`: "Completely Separate: No code sharing with India market infrastructure"
