# ADR-0003: Adoption of Regime-First Cognition

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Context**: Momentum strategies often fail in chopping (low volatility, mean-reverting) markets. Traditional systems try to run strategies constantly and rely on backtests to filter losing periods. This leads to drift and capital loss.

## Decision

All strategy execution must be preceded by a **Market Regime Classification** step. Strategies are only valid and active within specific regimes (e.g., TRENDING_UP, VOLATILE_DOWN).

## Rationale

- **Explicit Validity**: Forces explicit recognition of when a strategy *should* work.
- **Capital Protection**: "Strategy Drift" is prevented; capital is protected during unfavorable conditions.
- **Honesty**: The system admits when it doesn't know what to do (e.g., in an UNDEFINED regime).

## Alternatives

- **Always-Active Strategies**: Run strategies constantly and filter trades post-hoc. Rejected due to drift and high false positive rate.
- **Adaptive Parameter Tuning**: Let strategies adjust their own hyperparameters based on recent performance. Rejected as "Black Box ML Decision Engines" (Forbidden).

## Consequences

- **Dependency**: All strategies now depend heavily on the accuracy and stability of the Regime Engine.
- **Complexity**: Adds a significant layer of computation (Regime Classification) before any signal can be evaluated.
- **Stagnation**: In regime transitions or uncertainty, the system may simply sit idle (Honest Stagnation).

## Evidence

- `docs/epistemic/ledger/decisions.md`: D001
- `docs/memory/04_architecture/data_flow.md`: Layer 1 (Regime) precedes Layer 5 (Strategy)
