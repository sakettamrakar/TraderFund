# ADR-0005: Epistemic Freeze Protocol

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Context**: In complex systems, uncontrolled change ("drift") corrupts the architecture. We need a way to govern the evolution of the system's "Brain" (Cognitive Layers) to prevent accidental regressions and unauthorized mutations.

## Decision

The default state for all Cognitive Layers (Regime, Narrative, Factor, Strategy) is **FROZEN**. Any structural work or phase transition requires an explicit **Unfreeze Decision** (D-series decision) accompanied by a **Documented Impact Declaration (DID)**.

## Rationale

- **Drift Prevention**: Forces all significant changes to be explicit, reviewed, and authorized.
- **Cognitive Consistency**: Prevents "brain transplants" where core assumptions change without awareness.
- **Auditability**: Creates a clear ledger of *when* and *why* the system's thinking changed.

## Alternatives

- **Continuous Evolution**: Code changes happen in PRs as features are ready. Rejected as insufficient governance for high-stakes logic.
- **Versioned Components**: Each component has a semantic version. Used in conjunction, but insufficient for *system-level* coherence.

## Consequences

- **Friction**: Unlocking a phase or layer requires governance documentation (DID) and a Decision Ledger entry, slowing down casual development.
- **Process**: Developers must plan changes structurally (DWBS) rather than impulsively.
- **Clarity**: The state of the system ("Frozen v1.1", "Unfrozen Phase 2") is always unambiguous.
