# ADR-0007: Immutable Decision Ledger

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Context**: Critical decisions are often lost in commit messages, chat logs, or developer memory. This leads to drift, regression, and inconsistency over time. We need a way to **permanently record intent and reasoning**.

## Decision

The **Decision Ledger** (`decisions.md`) is the **Epistemic Authority** for the system. Decisions are:

- **Immutable**: Once recorded, they cannot be deleted or modified (superseded only).
- **Authoritative**: Override all lower-level docs (e.g., source comments).
- **Append-Only**: New entries document evolution.

## Rationale

- **Memory**: The system "remembers" its own architectural evolution, even across developers/operators.
- **Traceability**: Decisions can be linked to code changes (DID-driven).
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves ambiguities in requirements or implementation.

## Alternatives

- **Commit Messages**: Rely on Git history. Rejected (too transient, hard to query).
- **Separate Wiki**: Separate documentation site. Rejected (divergence from code).
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Ask the developer. Maximum failure.

## Consequences

- **Overhead**: Requires disciplined writing of DIDs and Ledger entries.
- **Formality**: Adds a step to the development workflow (Decision -> Documentation -> Code).
- **Clarity**: Everyone knows *why* the system is this way.

## Evidence

- `docs/epistemic/ledger/decisions.md`: Lines 1-24
- `docs/epistemic/impact_resolution_contract.md`: Conflict Resolution Policy
- `README.md`: Canonical Documentation pointer
