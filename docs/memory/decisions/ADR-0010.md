# ADR-0010: Progressive Trust Model

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Context**: Releasing strategies or code to production is risky. A binary "Production / Research" flag is insufficient for managing the **lifecycle of trust**. We need a rigorous, reversible process.

## Decision

The system uses a **Progressive Trust** model. Strategies and Research Modules must earn promotion through a **5-Gate Process**:

1.  **Phase Threshold**: Module reaches defined Activation Phase (Roadmap).
2.  **Observation**: 30 error-free trading days in Research/Shadow state.
3.  **Paper Trading**: 100 consecutive trades with slippage < 5%.
4.  **Human Approval**: Explicit architectural sign-off (D0XX).
5.  **Test Coverage**: > 90% unit test compliance.

## Rationale

- **Safety**: Prevents premature deployment of unstable or unprofitable strategies.
- **Traceability**: Each promotion step is a distinct, auditable event (Promotion PR).
- **Meritocracy**: Strategies are judged on empirical performance, not political pressure.

## Alternatives

- **Developer Prerogative**: Dev "flips the switch". Rejected as ungoverned.
- **Backtest Validation**: Promote if backtest > X. Rejected (overfitting risk).
- **Continuous Deployment**: Auto-promote if tests pass. Rejected (requires human judgment on strategy quality).

## Consequences

- **Latency**: Strategy lifecycle is slow (months).
- **Process**: Requires discipline (Act -> Wait -> Observe -> Approve).
- **Reversibility**: Automated "demotion" is explicit (Kill-Switch).
